# ML Ops Example

## Summary
This example is a clear simple example of ML Ops which takes data from a service then applies concats the data to a Spark Database. The cron-add.py file in the data-ops folder is a placeholder for a live application. The spark-server is an application that receives auth 2.0 and will perform applications if auth'd. Pretty simple huh. Hopefully. This is a monorepo of sorts that works well with any CI/CD tooling. This is a clear cut example to get you running with ML Ops for a single ML model prediction model that trains against a Spark SQL database.


## Adoption-A-Tool

How do you adoption this tool do you ask? Simple: fork this repo and switch my pipeline with yours and my training model with yours. You should find that even this isn't a cookie cutter example that you should be able to tackle it no problem.
